description: We aim to build a system for identifying threatening traffic by classifying network traffic. It proposes an automated signature detection method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to solve problems with existing application traffic analysis. The system can automatically analyze traffic content without prior knowledge or signatures, allowing it to detect and classify traffic signatures from new applications.
