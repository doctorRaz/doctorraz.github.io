title: Statistics-based Network Behavior Modeling
start_date: 2018-05-01
end_date: 2018-10-31
description: We focused on statistical-based network behavior modeling to develop technology that efficiently classifies network traffic and detects unusual signs that deviate from normal patterns. To overcome the limitations of traditional port-based and payload-based traffic classification methods, we used host behavior analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) techniques to identify traffic characteristics and patterns, which increased our classification accuracy. For user convenience, we developed a GUI-based traffic classification tool and added an x.509 certificate analysis feature to extract certificate information from SSL communication traffic. Using real-world laboratory data and public datasets, we analyzed various network behaviors, including server, client, and attack traffic. We then visually verified the anomalies using BLINC graphs and Radar charts. check
