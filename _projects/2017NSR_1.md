title: Characterization and Automatic Labeling of Malicious Traffic in Control System Networks
start_date: 2017-04-01
end_date: 2017-10-31
description: We proposes an automated method for classifying specialized network traffic in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), also known as SCADA. To address the limitations of existing traffic classification tools, which struggle to identify the unique traffic patterns in these critical systems, we leveraged Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a probabilistic text modeling technique. By treating a network traffic flow as a document and its payload data as words, the LDA model automatically extracts hidden "topics" (traffic signatures) to classify the flows. Applied to real-world water resource control system traffic data (approx. 44 GB), our method successfully classified 96.3% of the traffic that existing tools failed to identify, demonstrating its effectiveness and applicability in specialized SCADA environments.
