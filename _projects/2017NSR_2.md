description: We studied methods for collecting network traffic from anonymity networks, specifically the Tor network. It researched how to collect traffic, analyzed the collected data, and reviewed existing attacks on anonymity networks. The study focused on setting up a Tor Exit Node to collect unencrypted traffic, including the full packet payload. Data was also collected from a client's perspective, which confirmed that Tor circuits typically consist of relays from different countries and are frequently re-established to maintain user anonymity.
