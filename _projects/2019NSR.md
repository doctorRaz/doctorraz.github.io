description: We aim to solve the "explainability" problem, which makes it difficult to explain the reasons for the excellent performance of deep learning-based network traffic classification and threat detection technologies. We evaluated the performance of various deep learning algorithms for traffic classification and, in particular, proposed a method of applying the Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN), a natural language processing technique, to network traffic classification. Furthermore, through attention visualization analysis, an explainable AI (XAI) technique, we identified which elements the deep learning model focuses on during traffic classification. The HAN model was adapted for this purpose by leveraging the similarity between the hierarchical structure of traffic data (flow-packet-byte) and the structure of natural language (document-sentence-word).
